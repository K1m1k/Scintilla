Introduction

This project simulates an integrated consciousness system that combines Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), Deep Q-Learning (DQN), latent reasoning, memory management, emotion simulation, and online data fetching. The system is designed to process sensory inputs, generate creative outputs, manage priorities dynamically, and simulate emotional responses.

Features

Generative Creativity: Uses a GAN to produce creative embeddings based on input data.

Dynamic Feedback: Implements a DQN system for adaptive decision-making and feedback.

Latent Reasoning: Refines latent representations using a GRU-based recurrent module.

Memory Management: Includes multiple memory types (sensorial, operational, transitory, long-term, episodic).

Online Data Integration: Fetches relevant online data via Google Custom Search API to enrich the context of sensory inputs.

Sandbox Simulation: Periodically updates a sandbox environment to reflect the current state of the system.

Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/consciousness-system.git
cd consciousness-system

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

Using a virtual environment ensures dependency isolation and avoids conflicts with other Python projects.

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Obtain API keys for online data fetching:

Sign up for a Google Custom Search API key and replace YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY and YOUR_CSE_ID in the code.

Run the project:

python main.py

Usage

The main entry point of the project is main.py. It simulates the consciousness system by processing a list of raw inputs and producing an output based on the consolidated memory.

Example:

raw_inputs = [
    "I am feeling happy today.",
    "The weather is sunny and warm.",
    "I had a great conversation with my friend.",
    "I am learning new things every day."
]
consciousness_system.simulate_consciousness(raw_inputs)
output = consciousness_system.produce_output()
print(output)
